title: "A Sufficient Statistics Construction of Exponential Family Lévy Measure Densities
  for Nonparametric Conjugate Models"
abstract: Conjugate pairs of distributions over infinite dimensional spaces are prominent
  in machine learning, particularly due to the widespread adoption of Bayesian nonparametric
  methodologies for a host of models and applications. Much of the existing literature
  in the learning community focuses on processes possessing some form of computationally
  tractable conjugacy as is the case for the beta process and the gamma process
  (and, via normalization, the Dirichlet process). For these processes, conjugacy
  is proved via statistical machinery tailored to the particular model. We seek to
  address the problem of obtaining a general construction of prior distributions over
  infinite dimensional spaces possessing distributional properties amenable to
  conjugacy. Our result is achieved by generalizing Hjort’s construction of the
  beta process via appropriate utilization of sufficient statistics for exponential
  families.
