title: "{On the High Dimensional Power of a Linear-Time Two Sample Test under Mean-shift
  Alternatives}"
abstract: Nonparametric two sample testing deals with the question of consistently
  deciding if two distributions are different, given samples from both, without making
  any parametric assumptions about the form of the distributions. The current literature
  is split into two kinds of tests - those which are consistent without any assumptions
  about how the distributions may differ (\textitgeneral alternatives), and those
  which are designed to specifically test easier alternatives, like a difference in
  means (\textitmean-shift alternatives). The main contribution of this paper is to
  explicitly characterize the power  of a popular nonparametric two sample test, designed
  for general alternatives, under a mean-shift alternative in the  high-dimensional
  setting. Specifically, we explicitly derive the power of the linear-time Maximum
  Mean Discrepancy statistic using the Gaussian kernel, where the dimension and sample
  size can both tend to infinity at any rate, and the two distributions differ in
  their means. As a corollary, we find that if the signal-to-noise ratio is held constant,
  then the test’s power goes to one if the number of samples increases faster than
  the dimension increases. This is the first explicit power derivation for a general
  nonparametric test in the high-dimensional setting, and  the first analysis of how
  tests designed for general alternatives perform against easier ones.
