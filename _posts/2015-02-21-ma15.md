title: Active Pointillistic Pattern Search
abstract: 'We introduce the problem of active pointillistic pattern search (APPS),
  which seeks to discover regions of a domain exhibiting desired behavior with limited
  observations.  Unusually, the patterns we consider are defined by large-scale properties
  of an underlying function that we can only observe at a limited number of points.
  Given a description of the desired patterns (in the form of a classifier taking
  functional inputs), we sequentially decide where to query function values to identify
  as many regions matching the pattern as possible, with high confience.  For one
  broad class of models the expected reward of each unobserved point can be computed
  analytically.  We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three difficult search problems:
  locating polluted regions in a lake via mobile sensors, forecasting winning electoral
  districts with minimal polling, and identifying vortices in a fluid flow simulation.'
