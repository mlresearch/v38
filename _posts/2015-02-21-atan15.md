title: Global Multi-armed Bandits with Hölder Continuity
abstract: Standard Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems assume that the arms are independent.
  However, in many application scenarios, the information obtained by playing an arm
  provides information about the remainder of the arms. Hence, in such applications,
  this informativeness can and should be exploited to enable faster convergence to
  the optimal solution. In this paper, formalize a new class of multi-armed bandit
  methods, Global Multi-armed Bandit (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative
  through a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all
  the arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm with
  the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded parameter-dependent
  regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times, and
  after a finite number of initial time steps, the optimal arm is selected in all
  of the remaining time steps with probability one. In addition, we also study how
  the informativeness of the arms about each other’s rewards affects the speed of
  learning. Specifically, we prove that the parameter-free (worst-case) regret is
  sublinear in time, and decreases with the infor- mativeness of the arms. We also
  prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk bound for the GMAB which reduces to the
  well-known Bayesian risk bound for linearly parameterized bandits when the arms
  are fully informa- tive. GMABs have applications ranging from drug dosage control
  to dynamic pricing.
